StackFlow Overview

StackFlow is a next-generation Web3 financial super-app that combines instant blockchain payments with intelligent portfolio investing, all powered by PYUSD stablecoin on Arbitrum.
Think of it as "Apple Pay meets Robinhood" for crypto — making both payments and investing simple, fast, and accessible.

🎯 Core Problem Solved

Traditional crypto wallets are complex and intimidating. Users need to remember long hexadecimal addresses, manage gas fees, and can't easily invest in diversified crypto portfolios.

StackFlow solves this by:

Simplifying payments with human-readable handles (@username@pyusd) instead of wallet addresses

Democratizing investing through expert-curated, auto-rebalancing crypto portfolios

Reducing barriers with a beautiful, intuitive UX inspired by Apple Pay and Paytm

Ensuring security with enterprise-grade AES-256 encryption and server-side transaction signing

💳 Payment Features
Smart Blockchain Payments

Create unique payment handles like @alice@pyusd or @bob@pyusd

Send PYUSD to anyone using their handle (no need to remember 0x... addresses)

Real-time transaction tracking with blockchain explorer integration

Automatic wallet generation on signup (users never see private keys)

Encrypted private key storage in Supabase with AES-256 encryption

Server-side transaction signing for maximum security

Payment Links

A shareable link system that enables users to create custom payment requests — similar to Venmo or PayPal links, but fully on-chain with PYUSD.

How it works:

Create a link with amount, description, and optional expiry

Get a shareable URL (e.g., stackflow.app/pay/abc123) or QR code

Recipients click, connect wallet, and pay instantly

Track real-time payment status (paid, pending, expired)

Key capabilities:

Fixed or flexible payment amounts

Custom memos/descriptions (e.g., “Coffee ☕”, “Rent split”)

Expiration and one-time/reusable links
