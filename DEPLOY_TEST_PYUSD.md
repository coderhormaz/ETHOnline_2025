9. Confirm transaction in MetaMask
10. **Copy the deployed contract address**

**Option B: Using Hardhat**

npm install --save-dev hardhat @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox

# Initialize Hardhat
npx hardhat init

# Copy TestPYUSD.sol to contracts/
# Deploy

```

### 3. Update .env File
Replace the contract address in `.env`:
```
VITE_PYUSD_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=<YOUR_DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS>
```

### 4. Get Test Tokens
After deploying, you can mint tokens in two ways:

**Option A: Using Remix**
1. In Remix, under "Deployed Contracts"
2. Click on your TestPYUSD contract
3. Click "faucet" button ‚Üí Click "transact"

2. Click "Contract" ‚Üí "Write Contract"
3. Connect wallet
4. Call `faucet()` function

### 5. Verify Your Setup
1. Restart your dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Login to your app
3. Check browser console for logs:
   - "‚úÖ PYUSD Contract Info" should show your contract details
   - "üí∞ PYUSD Balance" should show your balance
4. Go to Transactions page and click refresh icon
5. You should see your transactions!

## Troubleshooting

### Balance shows 0 even after minting
- Check you're minting to the same wallet address shown in your app
- View your wallet address in app: Dashboard ‚Üí Wallet Overview
- Compare with wallet in MetaMask

### Contract verification failed
- Make sure the contract address in .env is correct
- Check the contract exists: https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/YOUR_ADDRESS
- Try restarting the dev server

### No transactions showing
- Make sure you've made at least one transfer/mint
- Check the transaction was confirmed on Sepolia
- Click the refresh button on Transactions page
- Check browser console for error messages
