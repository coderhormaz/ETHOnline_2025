## 🚨 IMPORTANT NOTES

### Before Testing Payments:
1. **Get ETH for gas** - Use Arbitrum testnet faucet
2. **Get PYUSD/USDT** - For actual transfers
3. **Wait for confirmations** - 15-30 seconds
4. **Refresh dashboard** - To see updated balance

### Security Reminders:
- ✅ Private keys encrypted with AES-256
- ✅ Keys NEVER sent to client
- ✅ All transactions signed server-side
- ✅ RLS protects database access

### Production Deployment:
- ⚠️ Generate NEW encryption key for production
- ⚠️ Never reuse development keys
- ⚠️ Set all env vars in hosting platform
- ⚠️ Update Supabase CORS allowlist
